Module 7 - Day 10
Should I carry the Umbrella with me?
You are in charge of building, using React and OPTIONALLY any new skill learned in this module a new App for checking the weather around the world:
TypeScript
functional components
hooks
Redux
The user should be able to select the city and receive the weather info (it's going to rain? temperature? next days?)
You can use Open Weather APIs to build your own Weather website!
https://openweathermap.org/api
Study the APIs, if you choose to go with TS build your interfaces and start building the best weather app out there!
